Alita is a Telegram Group managment bot made using **[Gotgbot](https://github.com/PaulSonOfLars/gotgbot)** and **[Go](https://go.dev)**, which makes it modern and faster than most of the exisitng Telegram Chat Managers.

**Alita's features over other bots:**
- Modern
- Fast
- Fully asynchronous
- Fully open-source
- Frequently updated
- Multi Language Support

Can be found on Telegram as [@Alita_Robot](https://t.me/Alita_Robot)
</br>

Alita is currently available in 1 Language as of now:
- **US English**

More languages can be managed in the _locales_ folder.

More langauges have been added to locales folder but need some configuration.


Help us bring more languages to the bot by contributing to the project on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/alitarobot)

## Requirements
- You need to have a *Mongo Database* (Cluster Preferred)
- Linux/Windows machine (Ubuntu/Debain-based OS Preferred or Windows 10/Server2016 and later)

or
- Docker (Easiest way to setup the bot)


## How to setup

First Step!
- Star **‚≠ê** the repository!!
- Fork **üî±** the repository before deploying and make changes in the fork.

It really motivates me to continue this project further.

### Deploy to Heroku
- Get your `API_ID` and `API_HASH` from [here](https://my.telegram.org/)
- Get your Bot Token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/ROYAL-GAGAN-786/Channel-Post-Filter-Bot)



**Note:** As it is banned with an unknown reason in heroku, follow the below steps carefully!
- First Fork this repo :)
- secondly, create an empty app in the Heroku, with a custom app name; and select Europe region for faster speed.
- Now go to the deploy tab of your app and under deployment method select GitHub and connect it.
- after that, type the forked repo name and select it now select main branch and enable auto deploy, at last click on deploy now button!
- Lastly, you must fill up all the vars in heroku as directed in app.json file and now turn on the worker dyno to run it :)

### Traditional

- Download a binary from [releases](https://github.com/Divkix/Alita_Robot/releases) page specific to your PC.
- Set the required env variables and run the binary

**Note:** Not a lot of people may be able to run using this because the instructions aren't clear but I'll try to make it clear in future.

### Docker

- Clone the repo and enter into it
- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- Run `docker build -t alita .` if you're using your forked repo, else run `docker run -e ENV_VAR=VALUE -d --name alita divkix/alita_robot`


If all works well, bot should send message to the **MESSAGE_DUMP** Group!


## Contributing to the project

- Make sure your PR works and doesn't break anything.
- You must join the support group.
- Make sure it builds and runs properly.
